                <li>for “service administration purposes”, which means that Pizza Gusto may contact you for reasons related to the service, activity or online content you have signed up for, as set out in section 6 below (e.g. to provide you with password/pin reminders, to notify you that a particular service, activity or online content has been suspended for maintenance, to notify you of updates to our Privacy and Cookies Policy or Terms of Use, to let you know if your Pizza Gusto account has become dormant and to ask if you would like to use it again before we close it);</li>
                <li>where we provide personalised services, we may analyse the information you supply, as well as your activity using our products and services, so that we can offer a more relevant, tailored service.

                We may use information which we hold about you to show you relevant advertising on third party sites (e.g. Facebook, Google, Instagram, Snapchat and Twitter). This could involve showing you an advertising message where we know you have a Pizza Gusto account and have used Pizza Gusto products and services. If you don’t want to be shown targeted advertising messages from Pizza Gusto, some third party sites allow you to request not to see messages from specific advertisers on their sites in the future.
                There are several ways you can stop direct marketing communications from us:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Click the ‘unsubscribe’ link or ‘opt out’ link or ‘preference centre’ link in any email communication that we send you. We will then stop any further emails from that particular source.</li>
                <li>If you have an account, log in into your Pizza Gusto account, visit the ‘Account Information’ area and change your preferences.</li>

            </ul>
            <p>Please note that you may continue to receive communications for a short period after changing your preferences while our systems are fully updated.</p>
            <h3>8. Will Pizza Gusto share my personal information with anyone else?</h3>
            <p>We will keep your information within the Pizza Gusto group of companies except where disclosure is required or permitted by law (for example to government bodies and law enforcement agencies, including for child protection reasons).</p>
            <p>Generally, we will use your information within Pizza Gusto and will only share it outside Pizza Gusto where you have requested it or given your consent. However, we may share with third party sites (e.g. Facebook, Google, Instagram, Snapchat and Twitter) some data, with appropriate security measures.</p>
            <p>Sometimes Pizza Gusto uses third parties to process your information on our behalf, for example to provide services (e.g. click and collect service) or analysis. Pizza Gusto requires these third parties to comply strictly with its instructions and Pizza Gusto requires that they do not use your personal information for their own business purposes, unless you have explicitly consented to the use of your personal information in this way.
                We may transfer personal data that we collect from you to third-party data processors in countries that are outside the European Union such as Australia or the USA.
                For example, this might be required in order to fulfil your order, process your payment details or provide support services.</p>
            <p>If we do this, we have procedures in place to ensure your data receives the same protection as if it were being processed inside the EU. For example, our contracts with third parties stipulate the standards they must follow at all times. If you wish for more information about these contracts please contact our Data Protection Officer.</p>
            <p>Any transfer of your personal data will follow applicable laws and we will treat the information under the guiding principles of this Privacy Notice.</p>
            <h3>9. What if I am a user aged under 16?</h3>
            <p>Protecting children’s privacy online is extremely important to Pizza Gusto. Our online services are intended for general audiences and do not knowingly collect any personal information from children. When users identify themselves as being children (i.e. under the age of 16), consistent with applicable law we will not provide a path for them to input personal information or we will in some circumstance obtain consent from parents for the collection, use, and sharing of their children’s personal information.</p>
            <h3>10. How long will Pizza Gusto keep my personal information?</h3>
            <p>We will hold your personal information on our systems for as long as is necessary for the relevant activity, or as long as is set out in any relevant contract you hold with Pizza Gusto. If you delete your Pizza Gusto account then your personal information is deleted immediately where such data is not required to be kept by law or tax purposes. When information is required to be kept by law or for tax reasons, we will hold such information for 6 full tax years or such longer periods if stipulated by relevant legislation or tax law. Any remaining information is anonymised for analytical purposes. For further information about deleting your Pizza Gusto account, please see section 11 below.
                If you’ve not used your Pizza Gusto account or any Pizza Gusto online services for more than five years, it will be flagged as inactive and we’ll contact you to ask whether you want to keep it open. Unless you reply to say ‘yes’ within the stipulated timeframe, we’ll close the account and delete or anonymise the personal data associated with it unless such data include transactional data that is required to be kept by law or for tax purposes.</p>
            <h3>11. Can I delete my data?</h3>
            <p>If the data we hold about you is not required for us to fulfil a legal obligation, you can delete your personal data by contacting us by email at privacy@pizzagusto.com or through our Contact Us form on our website.
                As explained in section 10 above, deleting your Pizza Gusto account will erase any personal information in your account that we have about you, other than personal data that we are required to keep by law or tax law and it will mean any data we hold about how you have used Pizza Gusto products and services will be made anonymous.</p>
            <h3>12. Your Rights</h3>
            <p>Here is a list of the rights that all individuals have under data protection laws. They don’t apply in all circumstances. If you wish to use any of them, we’ll explain at that time if they are engaged or not:</p>
